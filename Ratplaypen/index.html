        <h1>About Rat Playpen</h1>
        <p>Rat Playpen strives to educate people about our furry little friends giving the proceeds of our sales to Shelters for Rats, because of the revulsion many people have toward wild rats, pet rats are often mistreated,Seen as vermin and misunderstood. 
          pet rats commonly get no respect at many place and therefore don't get the care they need or deserve.
        At most pet shops, rats are not treated as valued pets but as cheap disposable food for reptiles. Many shops keep their rats in crowded, dirty conditions, letting sick rats suffer and die without medical care.
       We want to help educate and also help give rats a better loving home who have been abused or abandoned as well as spreading the word to help the misinformed.
        
        Rats are wonderful loving pets, They're clever and love attention and snuggles just as much as your household pet does.</p>
